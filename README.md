# Italian Demographics

This notebook shows a simple exercise of how to use pandas to read data, combine data, plot data, use interactive widgets from within Jupyter notebooks, write an animation file using matplotlib plotting functions.
At the same time, it shows the dramatic decline of Italian demographics from the 80s to today.

## Data
Data from the [Italian Institute of Statistics](www.istat.it).
I had to manually download edit the single text files to make them readable.
Data in the data folder number 1-5 corresponds to regional statistics, which I haven't used so far.
Also, demographics by age is available.

## Notes
For some weird reason data between 2011 and 2018 is not available.
Italians don't know their demographics since 2011?!
